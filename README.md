# Molten Core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Thimoteus/molten-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Thimoteus/molten-core)

This is a modest extension of [prelude-ls](http://preludels.com/) I've written
of functions I've needed to use across different files.

## Usage

    npm install
    make

Now you can require the `build/core.js` file.

If you're on node.js version 0.8, you must `npm install -g npm@~1.4.6` first.

## Tests

    make test
